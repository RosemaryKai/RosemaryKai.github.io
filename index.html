          <h2>Welcome to Buffalo!</h2>
          <p>
            The city and the experience: a devoted football culture, winters that separate the soft from the stubborn,
            and a sauce so good it turned a simple wing into an American classic.

        <h2 id="football-heading">Football: Buffalo Bills </h2>
        <p>
          If you've been to Buffalo on a Sunday in the fall, you know football is less a pastime and more a religion.
          The Buffalo Bills bring together families, lifelong fans, and anyone who appreciates a stadium that feels like
          a community. Wins are celebrated loudly; losses are mourned with equal intensity.
        </p>
        <p class="opinion">
          Honest take: the team's highs are glorious and cathartic, the lows sting for a while — but that loyalty is
          beautiful. If you're into dramatic momentum swings, this is the franchise for you.

        <h2 id="winters-heading">Snowy Winters</h2>
        <p>
          Buffalo winters are an acquired taste. Lake-effect snow can show up fast and with attitude; streets, roofs,
          and trees disappear under sculpted drifts. It's inconvenient, it's dramatic, and somehow it becomes part of
          the local identity.

        <h2 id="sauce-heading">Buffalo Sauce... yum... </h2>
        <p>
          Born in a modest bar kitchen and upgraded to national fame, Buffalo sauce is simplicity done well:
          hot sauce + butter + a little vinegar + personality. It stains shirts and wins arguments.
        </p>

          <h3>Why it works</h3>
          <p>
            The trick is balance — heat, fat, and acidity. Too much heat and you lose flavor; too much butter and it goes
            limp. The best Buffalo sauces hit a bright, vinegary note and finish with a chili kick.
