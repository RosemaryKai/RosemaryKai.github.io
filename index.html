          <h2>Welcome to Buffalo!</h2>
          <p>
            The city of good neighbors! Lovers of football, winters that will tear you apart, and 
            sauce soo good that nobody can ever seem to replicate it correctly...

        <h2 id="football-heading">Football: Buffalo Bills </h2>
        <p>
          Buffalonians and Football.. while not all of them are like this (I am one who is not myself)... go hand-and
          -hand with football! The games bring together neighborhoods and communities just to see their favorite team
          get smoked in the field. I honestly admire the dedication.

        <p>
          Buffalo being right on a great lake massively effects the winters we had. Most people despise it but I myself
          LOVED the winters of Buffalo! Despite this, they can be very dangerous- and if you're caught in a blizzard... 
          you're probably in a lot of danger.
        </p>
    <article id="Lake" class="section lake" aria-labelledby="lake-heading">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2 id="lake-heading">Buffalo Sauce... yum... </h2>
        <p>
          Speaking of the lake... it's incredibly beautiful when it's not terrorizing us with infinite snowfall! Lake
          Erie is a wonderful place to visit... and even if you're not visiting it, it's a wonderful place to drive by!
          Coincidentally, it's in a perfect place for us to wave good morning to our neighbors to the north-- Canada!
        </p>
    <article id="History" class="section history" aria-labelledby="history-heading">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2 id="history-heading">Buffalo Sauce... yum... </h2>
        <p>
          Finally, the history! Believe it or not, but Buffalo used to be a very important city! It's where the Erie
          Canal travels through... it was a massive producer of steel! Although not all of Buffalo's history is good...
          It's notorious for its Redlining that was so bad, effects last to this day.

          BUFFALO SAUCE!!!! IS THE BEST THING TO EVER TOUCH WESTERN NEW YORK. The city had graciously handed out it's
          beautiful ability to cook to the rest of the world.. only for them to CONSTANTLY GET IT WRONG!!! Nowhere does
          it like Buffalo.
