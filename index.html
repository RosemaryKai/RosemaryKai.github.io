          <h2>Welcome to Buffalo!</h2>
          <p>
            The city of good neighbors! Lovers of football, winters that will tear you apart, and 
            sauce soo good that nobody can ever seem to replicate it correctly...

        <p>
          Buffalonians and Football.. while not all of them are like this (I am one who is not myself)... go hand-and
          -hand with football! The games bring together neighborhoods and communities just to see their favorite team
          get smoked in the field. I honestly admire the dedication.

        <p>
          Buffalo being right on a great lake massively effects the winters we had. Most people despise it but I myself
          LOVED the winters of Buffalo! Despite this, they can be very dangerous- and if you're caught in a blizzard... 
          you're probably in a lot of danger.

        <p>
          BUFFALO SAUCE!!!! IS THE BEST THING TO EVER TOUCH WESTERN NEW YORK. The city had graciously handed out it's
          beautiful ability to cook to the rest of the world.. only for them to CONSTANTLY GET IT WRONG!!! Nowhere does
          it like Buffalo.
